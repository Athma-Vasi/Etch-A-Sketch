# The Odin Project - Etch-A-Sketch

This project is designed to teach DOM manipulation by building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch

## What did I learn?

**TL;DR**

- basics of Grid
- FormData class and the value of `this`
- nested `for` loops to generate a 2D grid
- using JS to set style properties
- using css variables to dynamically modify attributes
- using template literals to interpolate random functions into HSL attribute
- using keyframes and parsing solutions from stack overflow
